3. **Title** - Cyber_Fight
4. **Repository** - https://github.com/margaretbarajas/Cyber_Fight.git
    1. It would be pretty empty at the moment. But feel free to include a `README.md` file or even this `proposal.md` if you like.
5. **Description** - As a child carer, i want to make something that will allow my students to learn their alphabets and their sounds while also having fun by immersing themselves iin classic games such as mortal combat, as I and many of my students like transformers i want to make it transformers themed. this would not only be fun to play but allows them to learn alongside. interwining art and knowledge makes it easier for people to digest information especially for children who are visual learners.
6. **Features** - i want to use the true or false aspect we have learned in class to make the ansers multiple choice. when the correct answer is chosen, the player will attack.  i also want to add power ups when a certain level is reached. List down what features it will have and how do you plan/guess to the feature will be executed?
7. **Challenges** - some new skills i would have to learn is how to add a sprite/ art i want as the character to the game, and how to connect the code to it. i will also need to research how coding in games and coding in programming differs. adding the typical stuff such as a sountrack and sprites to the game.
8. **Outcomes** - Software projects are infamously hard to predict effort. It’s actually common that one might accomplish less than hoped for. List down in 2-3 short sentences the below outcomes:
    1. **Ideal Outcome** - ideally i would like to add the true/false aspect of the game as well as adding the movement to match the coorect choice ( throw a punch for correct answer and take damage for wrong answer ) as well as making it easy for children to navigate.
    2. **Minimal Viable Outcome** - What is the minimum viable outcome of this project that still works & demonstrates it’s usefulness or artistic/entertainment value? the minimum viable outcome would be atleast show the alphabets and their sounds correctly, if not the main thing i want to focus on is the mortal combat like aspect of the game.
    In other words, if the project turns out more challenging than anticipated, what are the bare essentials you consider as a good outcome?
